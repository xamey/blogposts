Earlier this year, [I tried to add Bearer JWT support into the new Rails 8 authentication generator](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54279), but I failed miserably.

If you're using your Rails app solely as an API, you may be interested authenticate your users with a Bearer token, as I always do.

I created this Rails 8.0.2 project that you could use as a starter : https://github.com/xamey/rails-with-jwt

The README should be sufficient to help you build with.
